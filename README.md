# Deploy-Pack-29110-5-1-2-Basic-library
##  EPF plugin  library and method to support the adoption of the ISO/IEC 29110-5-1-2 Basic profile guide


This is a [deployment package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_29110#Deployment_Packages) for the [ISO/IEC 29110-5-1-2 Management and engineering guide Basic profile](https://www.iso.org/standard/51153.html) of software engineering for very small entities (VSEs). VSEs are considered entities (or group or teams) with less than 25 members developing software. You'll find more information about the 29110 family at the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_29110) and, specially, the [WG24 website](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/claporte/English/VSE/).

The goal of the WG24 for the 29110 family  is to help VSEs to adopt __sofware engineering methods__ fitted to their contexts and sizes as easier as possible.

## Getting Started

This deploy package is modelled as a [EPF library](https://www.eclipse.org/epf/) using [EPF Composer](https://www.eclipse.org/epf/downloads/tool/tool_downloads.php). The library is intended to be imported into your EPF project and then be adjusted to fit your entity 29110 adoption needs.

You'll find useful tis excellent [tutorial to EPF Composer by Bjorn Tuft](https://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPF_Installation_Tutorial_User_Manual.pdf).


You can start using this package just installing a recent version of EPF Composer and importing to your project. For [running EPF Composer in Linux check this post](http://olea.org/diario/2018/11/02/EPF_Composer_in_Linux.html).
